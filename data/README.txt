In order to run this code  you need 

to be on a Unix system
Python 2.7
pyspark
pandas
matplotlib.

I have inculded a script that should install the libraries you need (excluding python). You will need to install python on your own(I didn't include it because the install can be different for your OS) Once you install python you can run the script with the command: ./setup.sh

You should be able to run this on windows but you will have to install the libraries on your own.

after everything is installed, while you are in the working directory just type python data.py which will run the first question.
You will need to uncomment the other questions in order to run them.

The answers and descriptions are in the folders named questionX.
