Assuming my friends like beer based on their aroma alone then the beers I would recommend would be:
Mighty Arrow Pale Ale
Hoppin' To Heaven IPA
Dogwood Stout
Watney's Cream Stout
North By Northwest Guldenbiere

I came to this conclusion by checking for the top beers with the highest aroma raiting based on question 3. If we wish to do a more in-depth analysis then we could limit the results to beers with a high aroma AND high overall score(closest to 5 star beers). We could also slice up the table to remove beers that are lower rated by reviewers(making it more of a populatity contest)
